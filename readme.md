## Welcome
***This is my custom api, which I will integrates a user's Deezer listening history dynamically into Discord, so that people can see what the user has recently listened to and how long they've been listening.***

Here is a step by step breakdown of what this api does:
- A user with a Deezer account, a Discord account, and a Facebook account authorizes the Discord api to connect to their Discord account and update their status.
-
